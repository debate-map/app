# Access policies

## Overview

To be written. For now, see [the proposal](https://debatemap.app/feedback/proposals/sTggOxurTaGShH97_QGwBg) and [the class](https://github.com/debate-map/app/blob/master/Packages/js-common/Source/DB/accessPolicies/%40AccessPolicy.ts).

Some brief notes:
* The access restrictions do not apply to the server itself, of course; it can access anything for its internal use. However, care should be taken so that that "internal use" doesn't "leak" sensitive information to the caller. (For example, let's say someone searches for all nodes with a given substring in its title, and the server omits an entry due to lacking permissions: if the paging system were to then be "missing" a slot in the first page, this would "leak" that someone made a node with that substring but hid the current user from accessing it [with the creator possibly identifiable based on context]. To resolve this, the server should make sure to not leave "gaps" after entry-removal.)
* The "access policy" system is applied using PostgreSQL row-level-security (RLS). However, this makes optimization (ie. batching) of live-queries more difficult; because of that, the access-policy system is kept simple for access-restrictions, so that the set of variable-combinations is small enough to still make "pools" that can batch among themselves. (users who are specifically included/excluded by a given access-policy do not batch with anyone; this should be okay, since this will apply to a very small percentage of users)

## Baking

> This "baking" process is not in use yet; currently, the RLS system queries the referenced policies to check access. (I'll re-evaluate it if/when the RLS policies start causing performance issues.)

To improve performance (and make it easier for the live-query system to detect permission changes), the access policies are not "used directly" for controlling access. Instead, an access-policy's settings are "baked into" special columns within the rows that they apply to.

Specifically, this field/column:
* c_accessFlags

Order of application (strongest [ie. first checked for] is last): c_accessFlags.base_grant, c_accessFlags.base_deny, c_accessFlags.user_grant_USERX, c_accessFlags.user_deny_USERX

This "baking" process occurs:
* When a row is first created.
* When an access-policy is modified. (the server searches for all rows affected, updating their baked columns)

## Tables using access-policies

Simple: (tables where row-access is entirely controlled by own-field access-policies, eg. `row -> refToAccessPolicy [check access through c_accessFlags cache-field]`]
* terms
* medias
* maps
* nodes

Derivative: (tables where row-access involves checking access-policies of associated rows, eg. `row -> refToOtherTableRow -> otherTableRow [verify by attempting other-table-row access]`):
* mapNodeEdits (must pass map's policy + node's policy)
* nodeLinks (must pass policy of parent and child, denying if either denies)
* nodePhrasings (must pass node's policy)
* nodeRatings (must pass own policy + node's policy)
* nodeRevisions (must pass node's policy)
* nodeTags (must pass policies of all referenced nodes)

Unique:
* commandRuns (must have "public_base:true" + must pass policy of associated map/node/etc.)
* userHiddens: (each user can only access their own row)
