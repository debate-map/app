# Backend (Rust)

Shortenings:
* "string-change": simply added an extra character to a string in the file `Packages/app-server/src/main.rs`. (first println in `main` function)
* "SW": Stephen Wicklund (aka Venryx) [number after SW indicates which of my computers; SW1=desktop, SW12=laptop]

# Frontend

* Path is currently: TypeScript [->tsc->] JS [->babel->] JS [->webpack->] js-bundle.
* Speed is alright, but could be improved. I'm planning to switch to Turbopack once it is ready for wider use.
