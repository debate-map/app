# Backend (Rust)

Notes:
* If you're benchmarking, and you've just changed the compiler config, some things to keep in mind:
	* 1\) It's recommended to clear the docker cache-mounts (ie. Rust's compilation cache across docker builds) before the benchmark compilation, to ensure no side-effects from previous builds (it seems that sometimes old cache is "partially used" and can change the size/build-times, or cause compile/runtime errors). To do so, run: `docker builder prune --filter type=exec.cachemount`
	* 2\) While the solid majority of the time it's sufficient to simply press "Trigger update" on dm-app-server in the tilt-ui, there is a strange issue that can happen on occasion, where docker starts (and then keeps) building using an old compilation config (even after clearing the cache-mounts). It happens rarely enough to not be worth major investigation, but if you notice/suspect that it has happened, restarting the tilt-up process seems to resolve it (maybe relating somehow to another pod having been the one to first build the rust-shared image). [Note that it's *possible* this may give different "clean compile times" then when having just the target (app-server) pod be compiled due to lock-waiting between the pods (unconfirmed) -- so for now, obtain clean-build compile timings without this full-tilt-reset involved.]

Descriptions of shortened terms/phrases:
* Developer machines:
	* sw1\) OS: Windows 10, CPU: Ryzen 7 1700X, RAM: 32gb (Stephen Wicklund's desktop)
		* Note: There is more fluctuation in background-processing on this desktop compared to my laptop ("sw2"); so for more stable comparisons between build configs, use the "sw2" timings instead.
	* sw2\) OS: Linux Mint, CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U, RAM: 64gb (Stephen Wicklund's laptop)
* Build contexts: host = host OS (no docker), dd = Docker Desktop, rd = Rancher Desktop, de = docker engine
* The compile-times listed are always the number printed by cargo itself. (ie. the XX [floored] in `"Finished dev [...] target(s) in XX.??s"`)
* The "size" column is for the size of the `app-server-binary` output, as printed using `ls -lh app-server-binary` at end of `Dockerfile`. (if there is a question mark after the size, it's an approximation based on docker layer size, at ~4mb larger than the binary)
* Build freshness/caching options: clean(noIncr), clean(incr), str(noIncr), str(incr)
	* Clean = build done just after "cargo clean". Str = build done just after adding one character to first println in `main` function of `Packages/app-server/src/main.rs`. NoIncr/Incr = Build done with cargo compile option `incremental` set (or defaulting) to `false` or `true` (respectively).
* General sorting philosophy: sort by column 1, then column 2, etc., with (generally) the "slowest" options in each column sorted to the top. (at least what was *expected* to be the fastest, eg. dev build-configs are always ordered after release ones, even though certain release configs outpace certain dev configs).

# Frontend

* Path is currently: TypeScript [->tsc->] JS [->babel->] JS [->webpack->] js-bundle.
* Speed is alright, but could be improved. I'm planning to switch to Turbopack once it is ready for wider use.
