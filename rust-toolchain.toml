# use nightly (at least outside of dockerfiles), so that it's easy to run tests and such
# edit: not actually switching to nightly yet; usefulness for tests is diminished by:
# 1) Incremental compiles take ~15-30s, due to lack of caching for proc-macros. (eg. async-graphql's)
# 2) Found another way to enable the test-running, using `rust-analyzer.runnableEnv` in ".vscode/settings.json".
