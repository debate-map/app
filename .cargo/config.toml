# note: to abort on panics, we could add [..., "-C", "panic=abort"] to the rustflags below;
#		however, the custom handler in main.rs is preferred, because it lets you customize how much stack-trace detail to print, and "conditionally abort"

# note: be careful about letting too many warnings build up that are not dealt with
# (it seems that warnings getting logged to the console can slow compilation down significantly, if there are a lot of them)
