# Debate Map

Monorepo for the client, server, etc. of the Debate Map website ([debatemap.app](https://debatemap.app)).

> Note: The "master" branch of this repo is showing the codebase for the new monorepo setup, where the backend is written in Rust (+[Postgraphile](https://github.com/graphile/postgraphile) atm), rather than using Firestore. It is still in development, so the <https://debatemap.app> website will have some discrepancies until this new version is ready and published.

# Overview

The [Debate Map](https://debatemap.app) project is a web platform aimed at improving the efficiency of discussion and debate. It's crowd-sourced and open-source, and welcomes reader contributions.

Its primary improvements are (in short):
* Restructuring dialogue to make use of both dimensions.
* Breaking down lines of reasoning into single-sentence "nodes".
* Providing rich tools that operate on those nodes -- such as rating, tagging, statistical analysis, and belief-tree sharing and comparison.

The maps are constructed from "claims" (blue), and "arguments" (green and red) which support/oppose those claims. This structure cuts down on reading time, and lets us focus on the underlying chains of reasoning instead of parsing statement meanings and connections.

## For all/most contributors

### Tasks (one-time, or very rare)

<!----><a name="setup-general"></a>
<details><summary><b>[setup-general] General repo setup</b></summary>

* 1\) Ensure [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (v14.13.0+) is installed, as well as [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) needed for Yarn workspaces.
	* Note: Installation of a new command-line tool generally requires that you restart your terminal/IDE in order for its binaries to be accessible simply by name (assuming the installer has added its folder to the `Path` environment-variable automatically). So if a step fails due to "Command X is not recognized", check this first. (To save space, this "restart your terminal/IDE before proceeding" note will not be repeated in other guide-modules/steps.)
* 2\) Clone/download this repo to disk. (https://github.com/debate-map/app.git)
* 3\) Install this repo's dependencies by running: `yarn install`
* 4\) There is an ugly additional step that used to be required here, relating to a messy transition in the NPM ecosystem from commonjs to esm modules. For now, this issue is being worked around in this repo through use of [these](https://github.com/debate-map/app/tree/master/patches) and [these](https://github.com/Venryx/web-vcore/tree/master/patches) patch files (which are auto-applied by npm/yarn). However, if you get strange webpack/typescript build errors relating to commonjs/esm modules, it's probably related to [this issue](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/pull/8396#issuecomment-894563662), which may then require another look at the patch files (or attempting to find a more reliable solution).
* 5\) Copy the `.env.template` file in the repo root, rename the copy to `.env`, and fill in the necessary environment-variables. At the moment, regular frontend and backend devs don't need to make any modifications to the new `.env` file; only backend deployers/maintainers (ie. those pushing changes to the cloud for production) have environment-variables they need to fill in.

<details><summary><b>[vscode] VSCode window setup</b></summary>

Prerequisite steps: [setup-general](#setup-general)

It's recommended to split your dev setup into two vscode windows:
* 1\) Window #1 in the `Packages` folder. Use this window to open files in `Packages/client`. (opening files in `Packages/js-common` is also fine)
* 2\) Window #2 in the repo root, for everything else. (server development, deployment, etc.)

Reasons:
* About half of the development work is done in `Packages/client`, since it is the "driver" of most changes/functionality. And having the workload split between the two windows (by "area of concern"), helps maintain tab-count sanity, and clarity of where a given file/tab should be located.
* A separate `tasks.json` file has been set up for the two folders, optimized for the frontend and backend "areas of concern"; by opening both vscode windows/instances, it's thus faster/easier to complete some guide-modules.

<!----><a name="tilt-notes"></a>
<details><summary><b>[tilt-notes] Notes on using Tilt</b></summary>

Prerequisite steps: [setup-backend](#setup-backend)

Notes:
* When making changes to files, and with Tilt live-updating the files in the pods, you may occasionally start hitting the error `Build Failed: error during connect` or `Build Failed: [...] Error response from daemon` or `Get "https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443/api[...]": net/http: TLS handshake timeout`. Not completely sure what causes it (see my SO comment [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68779828)), but I'm guessing the tilt-updating mechanism is overwhelming Docker Desktop's kubernetes system somehow. To fix:
	* Option 1 (recommended): Completely close Docker Desktop, shutdown WSL2 (`wsl --shutdown`) [not always necessary], restart Docker Desktop, then rerun `npm start backend.tiltUp_local`.
	* Option 2 (sometimes fails): Right click the Docker Desktop tray-icon and press "Restart Docker".
* **Manually restarting the "pgo" resource will clear the database contents! Use with caution.**

## For backend developers (coding app-server, web-server, etc.)





### Tasks (one-time, or very rare)

<!----><a name="setup-backend"></a>
<details><summary><b>[setup-backend] Setting up base tools needed for local/remote k8s deployments</b></summary>

Required:
* 1\) Install Rust via the `rustup` toolkit: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
	* 1.1\) If using VSCode, it's highly recommended to install the [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) extension.
* 2\) Install Tilt: https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt
	* 2.1\) If the `tilt` binary was not already added to your `Path` environment variable (depends on install path), do so.
* 3\) Install Helm (eg. for some Tilt extensions): https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install
	* 3.1\) On Windows, recommended install steps:
		* 3.1.1\) Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install). (if `choco` command not already present)
		* 3.1.2\) Run: `choco install kubernetes-helm`
* 3\) Install a Docker container system.
	* 3.1\) If on Windows, you'll first need to [install WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). For the simple case, this involves...
		* 3.1.1\) Run `wsl --install`, restart, wait for WSL2's post-restart installation process to complete, then enter a username and password (which is probably worth recording).
		* 3.1.2\) It is highly recommended to set memory/cpu limits for the WSL system (as [seen here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66797264)), otherwise it can (and likely will) consume nearly all of your device's resources.
	* 3.2\) Before installing your Docker container system, make sure the version you're installing is compatible with Debate Map's requirements. Currently, the repo is developed on machines with Kubernetes v1.21.5 (as part of Docker Desktop 4.2.0) and v1.24.2 (as part of [Docker Desktop 4.11.0](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#docker-desktop-4110)), so it's recommended to install one of those versions (preferably the newer one).
	* 3.3\) On Windows and Mac, this means installing Docker Desktop (see step 3.2 above for recommended install link).
	* 3.4\) On Linux, it's also recommended to install Docker Desktop (see step 3.2 above for recommended install link). (installing Docker Engine on its own is apparently also possible, though not recommended, since these docs are written assuming Docker Desktop is installed)

Highly recommended: (frontend devs can skip, if setting up a minimal local backend)
* 1\) Install [Lens](https://k8slens.dev), a very handy, general-purpose k8s inspection tool. 
* 2\) Install [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download), a ui tool for viewing/modifying postgresql databases.

Additional tools: (frontend devs can skip)
* 1\) Install the VSCode [Kubernetes extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools), and connect it with your kubeconfig file (eg. `$HOME/.kube/config`).
	* 1.1\) Also install the [Pod File System Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sandipchitale.kubernetes-file-system-explorer) component, enabling the Kubernetes extension to display the file-tree of running pods, and open their files.
* 2\) Install the VSCode [Bridge to Kubernetes extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mindaro.mindaro), for replacing a service in a remote kubernetes cluster with one running locally (for easier/faster debugging).
* 3\) See here for more helpful tools: https://collabnix.github.io/kubetools

<!----><a name="setup-psql"></a>
<details><summary><b>[setup-psql] Setting up the psql tool</b></summary>

> Note: While installation of the `psql` tool on your host machine should not strictly be necessary (since there is an instance of it that can be accessed through some postgres-related docker containers), it is best to install it for more ergonomic usage: many of the helper scripts rely on it, and having it on your host machine makes it easier to use certain features, such as execution of .sql files present only on the host machine (eg. for when running the init-db and seed-db scripts).

Steps:
* 1\) First, make a note of which major version of Postgres you need. This should be Postgres v13 (unless this step has become outdated); to confirm, you can run `npm start ssh.db`, then in that shell run `psql --version`.
* 2\) Next, download/install the package containing the `psql` binary. This means either...
	* 2.1\) Option 1, installing the full Postgres software (keep same major version noted above): https://www.postgresql.org/download
	* 2.2\) Option 2, installing just the Postgres binaries needed for `psql` to operate.
		* 2.2.1\) On Windows, this means downloading and extracting the contents from the zip file here (keep same major version noted above): https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries
* 3\) Ensure the `psql` binary is added to your `Path` environment-variable.

<!----><a name="setup-k8s"></a>
<details><summary><b>[setup-k8s] Setting up local k8s cluster (recommended route)</b></summary>

Prerequisite steps: [setup-backend](#setup-backend)

> There are multiple ways to set up a local Kubernetes cluster, but this guide-module assumes you'll be using the recommended option of Docker Desktop. If for some reason you instead want to use K3d, Kind, etc., see the [setup-k8s-alt](#setup-k8s-alt) module.

#### Setup for Docker Desktop Kubernetes **(recommended k8s system)**

* 1\) Create your Kubernetes cluster in Docker Desktop, by checking "Enable Kubernetes" in the settings, and pressing apply/restart.

> To delete and recreate the cluster, use the settings panel.

#### After steps

* 1\) Create an alias/copy of the k8s context you just created, renaming it to "local":
	* 1.1\) For Docker Desktop, this means:
		* 1.1.1\) Open: `$HOME/.kube/config`
		* 1.1.2\) Find the section with these contents:
		```
		- context:
		    cluster: docker-desktop
		    user: docker-desktop
		  name: docker-desktop
		```
		* 1.1.3\) Copy that section and paste it just below, changing the copy's `name: docker-desktop` to `name: local`.
* 2\) [opt] To make future kubectl commands more convenient, set the context's default namespace: `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=app`
* 3\) For now, manually create an empty file at path `Packages/deploy/PGO/postgres/gcs-key.json`. (postgres-operator expects this file to be present; when deploying to the cloud we would need to fill in its contents, but for now an empty file is fine)

#### Troubleshooting

* 1\) If on Windows, your dynamic-ports range may start out misconfigured, which will (sometimes) cause conflicts with attempted port-forwards (from your Kubernetes pods to your localhost ports). See [here](https://superuser.com/a/1671710/231129) for the fix. (worth checking ahead of time on Windows, as it wasted considerable time for me)
* 2\) If your namespace gets messed up, delete it using this (regular kill command gets stuck): `npm start "backend.forceKillNS NAMESPACE_TO_KILL"`
	* 2.1\) If that is insufficient, you can either:
		* 2.1.1\) Help the namespace to get deleted, by editing its manifest to no longer have any "finalizers", as [shown here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52012367).
		* 2.1.2\) Reset the whole Kubernetes cluster. (eg. using the Docker Desktop UI)
* 3\) When the list of images/containers in Docker Desktop gets annoyingly long, see the [docker-trim](#docker-trim) module.

<details><summary><b>[setup-k8s-alt] Setting up local k8s cluster (using alternative k8s systems)</b></summary>

Prerequisite steps: [setup-backend](#setup-backend)

> There are multiple ways to set up a local Kubernetes cluster, with the recommened route being to use Docker Desktop, as described in the [setup-k8s](#setup-k8s) module. This module is for if you're certain you want to use an alternative like K3d or Kind.

Alternative options:
* K3d
* Kind

Notes:
* Docker Desktop has the advantage of not needing built docker-images to be "loaded" into the cluster; they were built there to begin with. This can save a *lot* of time, if full builds are slow. (for me, the deploy process takes ~3m on K3d, which Docker Desktop cuts out completely)
* K3d has the fastest deletion and recreation of clusters. (so restarting from scratch frequently is more doable)
* Docker Desktop seems to be the slowest running; I'd estimate that k3d is ~2x, at least for the parts I saw (eg. startup time).
* Docker Desktop seems to have more issues with some networking details; for example, I haven't been able to get the node-exporter to work on it, despite it work alright on k3d (on k3d, you sometimes need to restart tilt, but at least it works on that second try; with Docker Desktop, node-exporters has never been able to work). However, it's worth noting that it's possible it's (at least partly) due to some sort of ordering conflict; I have accidentally had docker-desktop and k3d and kind running at the same time often, so the differences I see may just be reflections of a problematic setup.

#### Setup for K3d

* 1\) Download and install from here: https://k3d.io/#installation
* 2\) Create a local registry: `k3d registry create reg.localhost --port 5000`
* 3\) Create a local cluster: `k3d cluster create main-1 --registry-use k3d-reg.localhost:5000` (resulting image will be named `k3d-main-1`)
* 4\) Add an entry to your hosts file, to be able to resolve `reg.localhost`:
	* 4.1\) For Windows: Add line `127.0.0.1 k3d-reg.localhost` to `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`.
	* 4.2\) For Linux: Add line `127.0.0.1 k3d-reg.localhost` to `/etc/hosts`. (on some Linux distros, this step isn't actually necessary)

> To delete and recreate the cluster: `k3d cluster delete main-1 && k3d cluster create main-1`

#### Setup for Kind

* 1\) Download and install from here: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation
* 2\) Run: `kind create cluster --name main-1 --image kindest/node:v1.24.2` (only versions 1.21.5 to 1.24.2 are known to work). The resulting image will be named `kind-main-1`
* 3\) Your cluster might fail with `too many open files` errors. Follow the guide at https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/known-issues/#pod-errors-due-to-too-many-open-files

> To delete and recreate the cluster: `kind delete cluster --name main-1 && kind create cluster --name main-1`

#### After steps and troubleshooting

* For this info, open the [setup-k8s](#setup-k8s) module, and read through the "After steps" and "Troubleshooting" sections.

<details><summary><b>[continuous-profiling] How to set up continuous profiling of the NodeJS pods</b></summary>

Note: We use New Relic here, but others could be used.  
Note: New Relic doesn't, by default, implement actual "continuous profiling"; it may support this as a component however. (will investigate)

* 1\) Create a New Relic account: https://newrelic.com
* 2\) Create a Kubernetes installation. (I used default settings)
	* 2.1\) Download the `newrelic-manifest.yaml` file, and place it in the `Packages/deploy/NewRelic` folder.
	* 2.2\) Proceed; it will take a few minutes, but be patient (without controlling/restarting any pods), and it should eventually start transmitting data to the web console.
* 3\) Add a NodeJS agent for the app-server pod.
	* 3.1\) Press "APM -> Add app/agent" from toolbar.
	* 3.2\) Proceed, and select "manual" for installation type. (manual installation persists past redeploys)
	* 3.3\) Proceed, setting the name to `app-server`, downloading the configuration file, and placing it in the `Packages/app-server` folder, but with the changes below:
		* 3.3.1\) Rename the file to `newrelic.cjs` rather than `newrelic.js`.
	* 3.4\) Let tilt redeploy the app-server pod, then press "See your data" on the New Relic page.
	* 3.5\) Wait a few minutes; the add-agent page in the New Relic console should eventually say it is receiving data, letting you then view the details.

Troubleshooting:
* You can try using the [nrdiag tool](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag).

<details><summary><b>[k8s-ssh] How to ssh into your k8s pods (web-server, app-server, database, etc.)</b></summary>

* For web-server: `npm start ssh.web-server`
* For app-server-rs: `npm start ssh.app-server-rs`
* For app-server-js: `npm start ssh.app-server-js`
* For database: `npm start ssh.db`
* For others: `kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -o name -n NAMESPACE -l LABEL_NAME=LABEL_VALUE) -- bash`

Note: If you merely want to explore the file-system of a running pod, it's recommended to use the [Kubernetes Pod File System Explorer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sandipchitale.kubernetes-file-system-explorer) VSCode extension, as it's faster and easier. For editing files, see here: https://github.com/sandipchitale/kubernetes-file-system-explorer/issues/4

<!----><a name="pod-quick-edits"></a>
<details><summary><b>[pod-quick-edits] How to modify code of running pod quickly</b></summary>

* 1\) Tilt is set up to quickly synchronize changes in the following folders: .yalc, Temp_Synced, Packages/js-common, Packages/app-server (in app-server pod)
* 2\) If you want to quickly synchronize changes to an arbitrary node-module (or other location), do the following:
	* 2.1\) Copy the node-module's folder, and paste it into the `Temp_Synced` folder.
	* 2.2\) Open a shell in the target pod. (see [k8s-ssh](#k8s-ssh))
	* 2.3\) Create a symbolic link, such that the target path now points to that temp-folder: `ln -sf /dm_repo/Temp_Synced/MODULE_NAME /dm_repo/node_modules`
	* 2.4\) To confirm link was created, run: `ls -l /dm_repo/node_modules/MODULE_NAME`
	* Note: These symlinks will be cleared whenever `yarn install` is run again in the pod. (eg. if your app's `package.json` is changed)

### Tasks (frequent)

<!----><a name="reset-db-local"></a>
<details><summary><b>[reset-db-local] How to init/reset the database in your local k8s cluster</b></summary>

Prerequisite steps: [setup-k8s](#setup-k8s), [setup-psql](#setup-psql)

* 1\) If there already exists a `debate-map` database in your local k8 cluster's postgres instance, "delete" it by running: `npm start "db.demoteDebateMapDB_k8s local"`
	* 1.1\) For safety, this command does not technically delete the database; rather, it renames it to `debate-map-old-XXX` (with `XXX` being the date/time of the rename). You can restore the database by changing its name back to `debate-map`. To find the modified name of the database, run the query: `SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datistemplate = false;` (to connect to the postgres server in order to run this query, run: `npm start "db.psql_k8s local db:postgres"`)
* 2\) Run: `npm start "db.initDB local"` (or manually: connect to postgres server/pod and apply the `./Scripts/InitDB/@InitDB.sql` script)
* 3\) Run: `npm start "db.seedDB local"` (or manually: connect to postgres server/pod and apply the `./Scripts/SeedDB/@SeedDB.sql` script)
	* 3.1\) If you get an error, changes may have been made to the expected database structure, with it being forgotten to update the `GenerateSeedDB.ts` code (or to regenerate its `@SeedDB.sql` output script). Open the `Scripts\SeedDBGenerator\GenerateSeedDB.ts` file, check for TypeScript errors, fix any you see, then run `npm start "db.seedDB_freshScript local"`.

</details>

<!----><a name="run-backend-local"></a>
<details><summary><b>[run-backend-local] How to run backend codebase, for local development</b></summary>

Prerequisite steps: [setup-k8s](#setup-k8s)

* 1\) If this is the first run, or if changes were made to the `app-server` pod (a js backend package we're transitioning away from), run the relevant `dev` script(s): `npm start app-server.dev` (has vsc-2 tasks)
* 2\) If this is the first run, or if changes were made to the `client` or `monitor-client` web/frontend codebases, run the relevant js-building and js-bundling script(s): [`npm start client.tsc` and `npm start client.build.prodQuick`] and/or [`npm start monitorClient.tsc` and `npm start monitorClient.build.prodQuick`] (has vsc-2 tasks)
* 3\) Launch the backend pods necessary for the behavior you want to test:
	* 3.1\) Option 1, by launching the entire backend in your local k8s cluster: **(recommended)**
		* 3.1.1\) If you have made any changes to dependencies that the backend uses, ensure the `Others/yarn-lock-for-docker.lock` file is up-to-date, by running: `npm start backend.dockerPrep` (has vsc-2 task)
		* 3.1.2\) Run (in repo root): `npm start backend.tiltUp_local`
		* 3.1.3\) Wait till Tilt has finished deploying everything to your local k8s cluster. (to monitor, press space to open the Tilt web-ui, or `s` for an in-terminal display)
	* 3.2\) Option 2, by launching individual pods/components directly on your host machine: (arguably simpler, but not recommended long-term due to lower reliability for dependencies, eg. platform-specific build hazards and versioning issues)
		* 3.2.1\) Start app server (if needed): `cd Packages/app-server-rs; cargo run` (not yet tested; also, waiting on [#43](https://github.com/debate-map/app/issues/43) to avoid need for special env-var)
		* 3.2.2\) Start web server (if needed): `cd Packages/web-server; cargo run` (not yet tested; also, waiting on [#43](https://github.com/debate-map/app/issues/43) to avoid need for special env-var)
			* 3.2.2.1\) As an alternative to starting the web server pod, you can try an alternative (webpack-based serving) described in the [run-frontend-local](#run-frontend-local) module.
	* Note: If changes were made that require changes to the db schema, you may hit errors on app-server startup. To resolve this, you can either reset your local database (see: [#reset-db-local](#reset-db-local)), or write/run a database migration (see: [#db-migrate](#db-migrate)).
* 4\) Backend should now be up and running. You can test the deployment by opening the main web frontend (eg. `localhost:[5100/5101]`), or interacting with one of the pages served by another pod (eg. the `graphiql` page at `localhost:5110/graphiql`).

<!----><a name="profiling"></a>
<details><summary><b>[profiling] How to profile the NodeJS pods</b></summary>

Prerequisite steps: [setup-k8s](#setup-k8s)

Chrome dev-tools profiler:
* 1\) Open the `Packages/app-server/[Dockerfile/deployment.yaml]` files, comment the `mode: normal` lines, and uncomment the `mode: profiling` lines. (and have tilt-up running, so these changes get applied)
* 2\) Open the page `chrome:inspect` in Chrome, and make sure "Discover network targets" is enabled.
* 3\) Press "Configure", and add `localhost:5115` and `localhost:5215` to the list.
* 4\) Ensure a port-forward is set up for one of those ports, to the running/target app-server pod. (see: [port-forwarding](#port-forwarding))
* 4.1\) It's possible that the port-fowards created by Tilt are not as "robust" as the ones created by `kubectl` (they seem to slightly more often have to "reconnect" during memory profiles, which breaks the transfer). If the kubectl port-forwards are desired, comment out the `... # for nodejs-inspector` line in `Tiltfile`, and then manually start the `npm start "backend.forward_remote onlyInspector"` command for step 4.
* 5\) The remote target should show up in the list. (if it doesn't, try refreshing the page and waiting; you can also press "Open dedicated DevTools for Node", which seems to connect faster)
* 6\) The dev-tools should work as expected. (Though note that I hit issues of the pod crashing in some cases [eg. memory dumps when memory usage was high], presumably from running out of memory. I'm not yet sure how to make this more reliable; perhaps by [enabling swap memory](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/09/run-nodes-with-swap-alpha).)
* 7\) When you're done with profiling, revert the changes made in step 1.

### Miscellaneous

## For backend deployers/maintainers

### Tasks (one-time, or very rare)

<!----><a name="cloud-project-init"></a>
<details><summary><b>[cloud-project-init] Cloud-projects initialization (eg. creating Google Cloud project for Pulumi to work within)</b></summary>

Note: We use Google Cloud here, but others could be used.

* 1\) Ensure you have a user-account on Google Cloud Platform: https://cloud.google.com/
* 2\) Install the Google Cloud SDK: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
* 3\) Authenticate the gcloud sdk/cli by providing it with the key-file for a service-account with access to the project you want to deploy to.
	* 3.1\) For the main Google Cloud project instance, you'll need to be supplied with the service-account key-file. (contact Venryx)
	* 3.2\) If you're creating your own fork/deployment, you'll need to:
		* 3.2.1\) Create a GCP project.
		* 3.2.2\) Enable the Container Registry API for your GCP project: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/containerregistry.googleapis.com
		* 3.2.3\) Create a service-account: (it's possible a user account could also be granted access directly, but service-accounts are recommended anyway)
			* 3.2.3.1\) Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/create
			* 3.2.3.2\) Choose a service-account name, and add the role "Container Registry Service Agent" and "Storage Admin" (*not* the weaker "Storage Object Admin").
			* 3.2.3.3\) In the "Service account admins role" box, enter your email.
			* 3.2.3.4\) In the "Service account users role" box, enter your email, and the email of anyone else you want to have access.
			* 3.2.3.5\) Create a key for your service account, and download it as a JSON file (using the "Keys" tab): https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
	* 3.3\) Move (or copy) the JSON file to the following path: `Packages/deploy/PGO/postgres/gcs-key.json` (if there is an empty file here already, it's fine to overwrite it, as this would just be the placeholder you created in the [setup-k8s](#setup-k8s) module)
	* 3.4\) Add the service-account to your gcloud-cli authentication, by passing it the service-account key-file (obtained from step 3.1 or 3.2.3.5): `gcloud auth activate-service-account FULL_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME_AS_EMAIL --key-file=Packages/deploy/PGO/postgres/gcs-key.json`
	* 3.5\) Add the service-account to your Docker authentication, in a similar way: `Get-Content Packages/deploy/PGO/postgres/gcs-key.json | & docker login -u _json_key --password-stdin https://gcr.io` (if you're using a specific subdomain of GCR, eg. us.gcr.io or eu.gcr.io, fix the domain part in this command)

</details>

<!----><a name="pulumi-init"></a>
<details><summary><b>[pulumi-init] Pulumi initialization (provisioning GCS bucket, container registry, etc.)</b></summary>

Prerequisite steps: [cloud-project-init](#cloud-project-init)

Note: We use Google Cloud here, but others could be used.

* 1\) Install the Pulumi cli: `https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install`
* 2\) Ensure that a Pulumi project is set up, to hold the Pulumi deployment "stack".
	* 2.1\) Collaborators on the main release can contact Stephen (aka Venryx) to be added as project members (you can view it online [here](https://app.pulumi.com/Venryx/debate-map) if you have access).
	* 2.2\) If you're creating your own fork/deployment:
		* 2.2.1\) Create a new Pulumi project [here](https://app.pulumi.com). Make sure your project is named `debate-map`, so that it matches the name in `Pulumi.yaml`.
* 3\) Run: `npm start pulumiUp` (`pulumi up` also works, *if* the last result of `npm start backend.dockerPrep` is up-to-date)
* 4\) Select the stack you want to deploy to. (for now, we always deploy to `prod`)
* 5\) Review the changes it prepared, then proceed with "yes".
* 6\) After a bit, the provisioning/updating process should complete. There should now be a GCS bucket, container registry, etc. provisioned, within the Google Cloud project whose service-account was associated with Pulumi earlier.
* 7\) If the deploy went successfully, a `PulumiOutput_Public.json` file should be created in the repo root. This contains the url for your image registry, storage bucket, etc. The Tiltfile will insert these values into the Kubernetes YAML files in various places; to locate each of these insert points, you can search for the `TILT_PLACEHOLDER:` prefix.

</details>

<!----><a name="ovh-init"></a>
<details><summary><b>[ovh-init] OVH initialization (provisioning remote kubernetes cluster)</b></summary>

Note: We use OVHCloud's Public Cloud servers here, but others could be used.

* 1\) Create a Public Cloud project on OVH cloud. (in the US, us.ovhcloud.com is recommended for their in-country servers)
* 2\) Follow the instructions here to setup a Kubernetes cluster: https://youtu.be/vZOj59Oer7U?t=586  
	* 2.1\) In the "node pool" step, select "1". (Debate Map does not currently need more than one node)  
	* 2.2\) In the "node type" step, select an option. (cheapest is Discovery d2-4 at ~$12/mo, but I use d2-8 at ~$22/mo to avoid occasional OOM issues)
* 3\) Run the commands needed to integrate the kubeconfig file into your local kube config.
* 4\) Create an alias/copy of the "kubernetes-admin@Main_1" k8s context, renaming it to "ovh". (open `$HOME/.kube/config`, copy the aforementioned context section, then change the copy's name to `ovh`)
* 5\) Add your Docker authentication data to your OVH Kubernetes cluster.
	* 5.1\) Ensure that your credentials are loaded, in plain text, in your docker `config.json` file. By default, Docker Desktop does not do this! So most likely, you will need to:
		* 5.1.1\) Disable the credential-helper, by opening `$HOME/.docker/config.json`, and setting the `credsStore` field to **an empty string** (ie. `""`).
		* 5.1.2\) Log in to your image registry again. (ie. rerun step 3.5 of [cloud-project-init](#cloud-project-init))
		* 5.1.3\) Submit the credentials to OVH: `kubectl --context ovh create secret --namespace app generic registry-credentials --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=PATH_TO_DOCKER_CONFIG --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` (the default path to the docker-config is `$HOME/.docker/config.json`, eg. `C:/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.docker/config.json`)
	* 5.1\) You can verify that the credential-data was uploaded properly, using: `kubectl --context ovh get --namespace default -o json secret registry-credentials` (currently we are pushing the secret to the `default` namespace, as that's where the `web-server` and `app-server` pods currently are; if these pods are moved to another namespace, adjust this line accordingly)

<!----><a name="dns-setup"></a>
<details><summary><b>[dns-setup] How to set up DNS and CDN (if creating own fork/deployment)</b></summary>

Note: We use Cloudflare here, but others could be used.

* 1\) If not done already, update the domain-names in the code and k8s YAML files (eg. `dmvx-ingress.yaml`) to point to your chosen domain-names.
* 2\) Create a Cloudflare account, and start the add-website process on it. Follow the instructions for basic setup.
	* 2.1\) On your domain registrar manager/website, make sure that you configure Cloudflare as the DNS Name Servers.
	* 2.2\) On Cloudflare, make sure that you add an entry for both the web-server and app-server. (both pointing to the OVH kubernetes cluster host-name)
* 3\) Enable the "SSL/TLS" -> "Edge Certificates" -> "Always Use HTTPS" option. (seems to not really be necessary, presumably because Traefik doesn't respond for non-https requests so Chrome retries with https automatically, but good practice)
* 4\) Set up a redirect from `www.YOUR_DOMAIN.YOUR_TLD` to `YOUR_DOMAIN.YOUR_TLD`. (using the Rules section, as [seen here](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/redirecting-www-to-non-www/2949/28))
* 5\) Expose the various debate-map subdomains as part of your Cloudflare proxy's DNS settings, using CNAME entries: app-server, monitor

<!----><a name="oauth-setup"></a>
<details><summary><b>[oauth-setup] How to set up oauth</b></summary>

In order to use the oauth options for sign-in (eg.

The below instructions are for creating those "application" configs/entries. (replace the domains with your own, of course)

Google Sign-in:
* 1\) Create a Google Cloud project for your fork.
* 2\) Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
* 3\) In the "Credentials->OAuth 2.0 Client IDs" section, create a new "Web Application" entry.
* 4\) Set the values below: (yes, the plain `localhost` one is [also needed](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68469319)) [replacing CLUSTER_IP_IN_CLOUD with the URL of your cloud-based Kubernetes cluster, if you want direct access to be possible]

<details><summary><b>[k8s-monitors] Various commands/info on monitoring system (prometheus, etc.)</b></summary>

* To open a bash shell in the main prometheus pod: `kubectl exec -it prometheus-k8s-[0/1] -n monitoring -- sh` (or just use Lens)
* To view the Grafana monitor webpage, open: `localhost:[3405/4405]` (`3405` for local, `4405` for remote, if using Tilt; if not, manually launch using Lens)
	> The page will ask for username and password. On first launch, this will be `admin` and `admin`.
	>
	> The Grafana instance has been preconfigured with some useful dashboards, which can be accessed through: Dashboards (in sidebar) -> Manage -> Default -> [dashboard name]. You can import additional plugins/dashboards from the Grafana [plugin library](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins) and [dashboard library](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards).
<!-- * To view the Prometheus monitor webpage, open (not currently working): `localhost:31002` -->
* To view the Prometheus monitor webpage, open the k8s cluster in Lens, find the `prometheus` service, then click it's "Connection->Ports" link.
	> The page will ask for username and password. On first launch, this will be `admin` and `admin`.
<!-- * To view the cAdvisor monitor webpage, open (not currently working): `localhost:31001` -->
* To view the cAdvisor monitor webpage [not currently working/enabled], open the k8s cluster in Lens, find the `cadvisor` service, then click it's "Connection->Ports" link.
* To view cpu and memory usage for pods using k8s directly (no external tools), run: `kubectl top pods --all-namespaces` (for additional commands, see [here](https://raaviblog.com/how-to-find-the-current-cpu-and-memory-usage-of-all-the-pods-in-kubernetes-cluster))

<details><summary><b>[port-forwarding] How to set up port-forwarding for your k8s db, etc.</b></summary>

For database pod:
* 1\) If you have tilt running, a port-forward should already be set up, on the correct port. (`5120` for your local cluster, and `5220` for your remote cluster)
* 2\) You can also set up the port-forwarding by running the script (has vsc-2 tasks): `npm start backend.forward_[local/remote]` (to only port-forward the db pod, add arg: `onlyDB`)

</details>

<!----><a name="k8s-psql"></a>
<details><summary><b>[k8s-psql] How to connect to postgres in your kubernetes cluster, using psql</b></summary>

Approach 1: (by ssh'ing directly in the k8s pod)
* 1\) Run: `npm start "ssh.db [local/ovh]"`
* 2\) Run (in vm shell that opens): `psql`
* 3\) The shell should now have you logged in as the `postgres` user.

Approach 2: (by using external psql with port-forwarding; requires that PostgreSQL be installed on your host computer)
* 1\) Set up a port-forward from `localhost:[5120/5220]` to your k8s database pod. (see: [port-forwarding](#port-forwarding))
* 2\) Run: `npm start "db.psql_k8s [local/ovh]"`

<!----><a name="db-migrate"></a>
<details><summary><b>[db-migrate] Database migrations</b></summary>

Old overview: <https://github.com/Venryx/web-vcore/tree/master/Docs/DatabaseMigrations.md>

New steps:
* 1\) Write a KnexJS script that modifies the db contents to match the new desired shape. (using native PG commands, for fast execution)
	* 1.1\) Make a copy of the latest migration in `Knex/Migrations`, and give it an appropriate name.
	* 1.2\) Write the migration code. (reference the older migration scripts to see patterns used)
* 2\) Enable a flag on the main `debate-map` database, which makes it read-only, and displays an explanation message to users.
	* 2.1\) Using DBeaver, create/modify the single row in the `globalData` table, setting `extras.dbReadOnly` to `true`.
	* 2.2\) If you want to customize the message that is shown to the users, set/modify the `extras.dbReadOnly_message` field. (default: `Maintenance.`)
* 3\) Create a copy of the database, named `debate-map-draft`.
	* 3.1\) Run: `TODO`
* 4\) Execute the migration script against the draft copy of the database.
	* 4.1\) Run: `TODO`
* 5\) Confirm that the draft database's contents are correct.
	* 5.1\) Open the (locally-served) new frontend's code, connecting to the draft database (by adding the `?db=prod-draft` flag to the url -- not yet implemented), and confirm that things work correctly.
	* 5.2\) You could also connect to the draft database using a tool like DBeaver, and confirm that the contents look correct there.
* 6\) Demote the main `debate-map` database. (ie. renaming it to `debate-map-old-XXX`)
	* 6.1\) Run: `npm start "db.demoteDebateMapDB_k8s ovh"`
* 7\) Promote the draft `debate-map-draft` database. (ie. renaming it to `debate-map`)
	* 7.1\) Run: `npm start "db.promoteDebateMapDraftDB_k8s ovh"` [not yet implemented]
* 8\) Disable the `dbReadOnly` flag in the `globalData` table. (see step 2)

### Tasks (frequent)

<!----><a name="k8s-remote"></a>
<details><summary><b>[k8s-remote] How to deploy web+app server packages to remote server, using docker + kubernetes</b></summary>

Prerequisite steps: [pulumi-init](#pulumi-init), [ovh-init](#ovh-init)

* 1\) Ensure that the distribution files are ready for any packages you've made changes to:
	1.1\) If you've changed files in `client`, then follow its ts->js transpilation instructions, then build the webpack bundle into an actual file, in production mode, by running `npm start client.build.prodQuick` (has vsc-1 task).
	1.2\) If you've changed files in `app-server`, then follow its ts->js transpilation instructions.
* 2\) Run: `npm start backend.tiltUp_ovh` (reminder: if you've made code changes, make sure the relevant ts->js transpilation and/or bundle-building has taken place, as accomplished through the `tsc`/`dev`/`build` scripts of each package)
* 3\) Wait till Tilt has finished deploying everything to your local k8s cluster. (to monitor, press space to open the Tilt web-ui, or `s` for an in-terminal display)
* 4\) Verify that the deployment was successful, by visiting the web-server: `http://CLUSTER_URL:5200`. (replace `CLUSTER_URL` with the url listed in the OVH control panel)
* 5\) If you haven't yet, initialize the DB, by following the steps in [reset-db-local](#reset-db-local) -- except replacing the `local` context listed in the commands with `ovh`.
* 6\) You should now be able to sign in, on the web-server page above. The first user that signs in is assumed to be one of the owner/developer, and thus granted admin permissions.

</details>

<!----><a name="k8s-troubleshooting"></a>
<details><summary><b>[k8s-troubleshooting] How to resolve various k8s-related issues</b></summary>

* 1\) In some cases, when pushing a new pod version to your k8s cluster, the pod will fail to be added, with the message `0/1 nodes are available: 1 node(s) had taint {node.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure: }, that the pod didn't tolerate.`
	* 1.1\) You can manually remove the taint by running (as seen [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63471551/2452165)): `kubectl taint node <nodename> node.kubernetes.io/memory-pressure:NoSchedule-`
		1.1.1\) Update: This didn't actually seem to work for me. Perhaps k8s is instantly re-applying the taint, since it's based on a persistent memory shortage? Anyway, currently I just wait for the memory shortage to resolve (somehow).
		1.1.2\) For now, another workaround that *seems* to help (from a couple tries), is opening pod-list in Lens, searching for all pods of the given type, selecting-all, then removing/killing all.
		1.1.3\) Another partial workaround seems to be to use Lens->Deployment, set Scale to 0, wait till entry updates, then set Scale to 1 again; in a couple cases this seemed to resolve the taint issue (maybe just coincidence though). 
* 2\) If you get the error "Unable to attach or mount volumes: unmounted volumes [...]" (in my case, after replacing a 4gb node-pool with an 8gb one), the issue may be that the stale persistent-volume-claims requested by the old nodes are still sticking around, causing new claims for the new node to not get created (issue [described here](https://veducate.co.uk/kubelet-unable-attach-volumes/)). To fix this:
	* 2.1\) Run `npm start backend.tiltDown_ovh`.
	* 2.2\) Tilt-down appears to not delete everything, so complete the job by using Tilt to manually delete anything added by our project: basically everything except what's in the `kube-node-lease`, `kube-public`, and `kube-system` namespaces.
		* 2.2.1\) Regular deletion (eg. through the Lens UI) works fine for the following found leftovers: stateful sets, config maps, secrets, and services.
		* 2.2.2\) For leftover namespaces: this deadlocks for me, seemingly due to the postgres-operator CRD having a deadlock occuring during its "finalizer", as [described here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52012367) (causing its `postgres-operator` namespace to stick around in a bad "terminating" state). See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52377328) to confirm what resources underneath that namespace are causing it to stick around, and then follow the steps below (assuming it's the CRD and/or PV/PVCs) to remove them, then the deadlocked namespace deletion task itself should complete. 
		* 2.2.3\) For the postgres-operator CRD, edit the manifest (eg. using the Lens UI's "Edit" option) to have its "finalizers" commented out, then delete like normal.
		* 2.2.4\) For the persistent-volumes and persistent-volume-claims, due the same thing: comment out its "finalizers", then delete like normal.
	* 2.3\) Rerun the tilt-up script.
	* 2.4\) EDIT: After doing the above, the issue still remains :(. Based on my reading, the above "should" fix it, but it hasn't. For now, I'm resolving this issue by just completely resetting the cluster. (with "Computing nodes" option set to "Keep and reinstall nodes" -- the "Delete nodes" option appears to not be necessary)

To create a backup:
* 1\) Option 1, using basic script:
	* 1.1\) Run: `npm start backend.makeDBDump` (has vsc-2 tasks)
	* 1.2\) A backup dump will be created at: `../Others/@Backups/DBDumps_[local/ovh]/XXX.sql`
* 2\) Option 2, using DBeaver:
	* 2.1\) Right-click DB in list. (this assumes you already are connected)
	* 2.2\) Press Tools->Backup, select "app_public", press Next, set format to "Tar", and press Start.

To restore a backup:
* 1\) TODO

<!----><a name="pgbackrest"></a>
<details><summary><b>[pgbackrest] Rich backups using pgBackRest (type: physical, focus: remote-storage)</b></summary>

General notes:
* Automatic backups are already set up, writing to the `debate-map-prod-uniform-private` bucket provisioned by Pulumi in the Google Cloud, at the path: `/db-backups-pgbackrest`.
* Schedule: Once a week, a "full" backup is created; once a day, a "differential" backup is created.

Backup structure:
* Backups in pgbackrest are split into two parts: base-backups (the `db-backups-pgbackrest/backup` cloud-folder), and wal-archives (the `db-backups-pgbackrest/archive` cloud-folder).
	* Base-backups are complete physical copies of the database, as seen during the given generation period. (well, complete copies if of type `full`; `differential` backups rely on the last `full` backup to be complete, and `incremental` backups rely on the last `full` backup, the last `differential` (if any), along with the in-between series of `incremental` backups)
	* Wal-archives are small files that are frequently being created, which is basically a streaming "changelog" of database updates. Wal-archives allow you to do point-in-time restores to arbitrary times, by augmenting the base-backups with the detailed sequence of changes since them.

Actions:
* To view the list of backups in the Google Cloud UI, run: `npm start backend.viewDBBackups`

To manually trigger the creation of a full backup:
* 1\) Run: `npm start backend.makeDBBackup`
* 2\) Confirm that the backup was created by viewing the list of backups. (using `npm start backend.viewDBBackups`)
	* 2.1\) If the backup failed (which is problematic because it seems to block subsequent backup attempts), you can:
		* 2.1.1\) Trigger a retry by running `npm start backend.makeDBBackup_retry` PGO will then notice the unfinished job is missing and recreate it, which should hopefully work this time.
		* 2.1.2\) Or cancel the manual backup by running: `npm start backend.makeDBBackup_cancel`

<!----><a name="pgbackrest-restore"></a>
<details><summary><b>[pgbackrest-restore] Restoring from pgBackRest backups</b></summary>

* 1\) Find the point in time that you want to restore the database to. Viewing the list of base-backups in the Google Cloud UI (using `npm start backend.viewDBBackups`) can help with this, as a reference point (eg. if you made a backup just before a set of changes you now want to revert).
* 2\) Prepare the postgres-operator to restore the backup, into either a new or the current postgres instance/pod-set:
	* 2.1\) Option 1, into a new postgres instance/pod-set that then gets promoted to master (PGO recommended way):
		* 2.1.1\) Ensure that the tilt-up script is running for the target context. (and disable any tilt-up scripts running for other contexts)
		* 2.1.2\) Uncomment the `dataSource` field in `postgres.yaml`, uncomment + fill-in the section matching the restore-type you want (then save the file):
			* 2.1.2.1\) If you want to restore exactly to a base-backup (without any wal-archive replaying), use the first section. (modifying "set" to the base-backup folder-name seen in the cloud-bucket)
				* 2.1.2.1.1\) At the moment, you also have to run a `psql` command to complete the restore. See [here](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator/issues/1886#issuecomment-907784977).
			* 2.1.2.2\) If you want to restore to a specific point-in-time (with wal-archive replaying), use the second section. (modifying "target" to the time you want to restore to, with a specified timezone [UTC recommended])
	* 2.2\) Option 2, into the existing postgres instance/pod-set (imperative, arguably cleaner way -- but not yet working/reliable):
		* 2.2.1\) Run: `npm start "backend.restoreDBBackup_prep BACKUP_LABEL"` This script patches the postgres-operator deployment/configuration to contain [the fields](https://access.crunchydata.com/documentation/postgres-operator/5.0.2/tutorial/disaster-recovery/#perform-an-in-place-point-in-time-recovery-pitr) that mark a restoration as active, and specify which backup to use.
		* 2.2.2\) To actually activate the restore operation, run: `npm start backend.restoreDBBackup_apply` This will update the `.../pgbackrest-restore` annotation on the postgres-operator CRD to the current-time, which the operator interprets as the "go signal" to apply the specifying restoration operation.
* 4\) Observe the logs in the Tilt UI, to track the progress of the restore. (it takes about 2.5 minutes just to start, so be patient; also, you can ignore the `WARN: --delta or --force specified but unable to find...` message, as that just means it's a fresh cluster that has to restore from scratch, which the restore module finds odd since it notices the useless [automatically added] delta/force flag)
	* Note: Until the restore process is completely done (eg. with the pgo operator having had time to update the admin-user auth-data secret), the app-server will be failing to start/connect; this is normal/fine.
* 5\) Check whether the restore operation succeeded, by loading up the website. (you may have to wait a bit for the app-server to reconnect; you can restart it manually to speed this up)
	* 5.1\) If you get an error in the `app-server` pod about `error: password authentication failed for user "admin"`, then it seems the `debate-map-pguser-admin` secret was already created (by pgo) prior to the restore, which may have made it invalid after the restore was completed (if the credentials differ). To resolve this, you can either:
		* 5.1.1\) Delete the `debate-map-pguser-admin` secret in the `postgres-operator` namespace; pgo will recreate it in a few seconds, with a working set of credentials (and the reflected version of the secret, in the `default` namespace, will be updated a few seconds later). Note that in this process, the admin user's password is actually reset to a new (random) value, so you will have to copy the secret's password value for use in third-party programs accessing the database (eg. DBeaver).
		* 5.1.2\) Alternately, you can modify the `debate-map-pguser-admin` secret (in the `postgres-operator` namespace) to hold the password value that was stored in the postgres backup that was just restored (this approach not yet tested, but presumably should work). One place you may have the old password stored is in DBeaver's password store, which can you decrept using [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58223703).
* 6\) If the restore operation did not succeed, you'll want to either make sure it does complete, or cancel the restore operation (else it will keep trying to apply the restore, which may succeed later on when you don't want or expect it to, causing data loss). To cancel the restore:
	* 6.1\) If option 1 was taken: Recomment the `dataSource` field in `postgres.yaml`, then save the file.
	* 6.2\) If option 2 was taken: Run: `npm start backend.restoreDBBackup_cancel`.
* 7\) After the restore is complete, clean things up:
	* 7.1\) If option 1 was taken: Recomment the `dataSource` field in `postgres.yaml`, then save the file. (needed so the restore operation is not attempted for other contexts, when their tilt-up scripts are run)
	* 7.2\) If option 2 was taken: No action is necessary, because the postgres-operator remembers that the last-set value for the `pgbackrest-restore` annotation has already been applied, and the restore config was only placed into the target context. (If you want to be extra sure, though, you could follow step 6.2; this is fine, because the restore has already taken place, so it will not be reverted or the like.)
* 8\) Note that after the restore (if using option 1 anyway), the password for the admin user may have changed (it seems to have this time anyway). If that happens, retrieve the new password from the `debate-map-pguser-admin` secret (eg. using Lens, though make sure to press the eye icon to decode it first!), and update the passwords stored in DBeaver and the like.

<details><summary><b>[pgbackrest-troubleshooting] How to resolve various pgBackRest issues</b></summary>

* 1\) If you ever get the error `command terminated with exit code 28: ERROR: [028]: backup and archive info files exist but do not match the database HINT: is this the correct stanza? HINT: did an error occur during stanza-upgrade?`, do the following:
	* 1.1\) First reference [this comment](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest/issues/1066#issuecomment-907802025) for some general info. (in retrospect, I think my observations there were only partly true, so take with a grain of salt)
	* 1.2\) Open a shell in the `debate-map-instance1-XXX` pod (using Lens or `npm start ssh.db`).
	* 1.3\) Run `pgbackrest info`. This should tell you which repos are having backup issues. Note that if repo1 (in-k8s backup) is having an issue, this appears to block backups to repo2 (cloud storage backup), so you'll likely have to debug/resolve repo1 issues first before making progress on repo2's.
	* 1.4\) Run `pgbackrest check --stanza=db` (note the stanza name: `db`). This should give the same error message that was encountered in the general pgo logs (the `[028] backup and archive files exist but do not match the database` error).
	* 1.5\) It might also be helpful to confirm that things look correct in various configuration files: `/etc/pgbackrest.conf`, `/etc/pgbackrest/conf.d/debate-map-instance1-XXXX.conf`
	* 1.6\) For actually resolving the issue:
		* 1.6.1\) First, think about what caused the backups to start failing. The reasons so far have been due to, eg. swapping out my k8s node for another one (4gb variant to 8gb). If that's the case, the changes needed to get the backups working again are probably minimal.
		* 1.6.2\) I don't know exactly what got the backups working again, but here the main actions I took, and in roughly the order I attempted (with something in there apparently resolving the issue):
			* 1.6.2.1\) Changing the `repo2-path` field in `postgres.yaml` from `/db-backups-pgbackrest` to `/db-backups-pgbackrest-X` for a while (with various actions, including the below, then taken), then changing it back. (with tilt-up running during this time)
			* 1.6.2.2\) Changing the `shutdown` field in `postgres.yaml` to `true` for a while; once I saw the database pods shut-down (other than `pgo` and the metrics-collectors), I commented the field again, causing the db pods to restart.
			* 1.6.2.3\) Attempting to run a manual backup, by running: `npm start backend.makeDBBackup`. (The pods attempting to make this backup did not start right away, iirc. When it did start [while messing with some of the steps below], it hit various errors [50, 82, then 62]. Eventually it succeeded, after the `pgbackrest start` command I believe -- at which point the regular cron-jobs showed up in Lens, and from those a full-backup job was created and completed.)
			* 1.6.2.4\) In the `debate-map-instance1-XXX` pod, run: `pgbackrest stanza-upgrade --stanza=db`. (failed with `ERROR: [055]: unable to load info file '/db-backups-pgbackrest-2/archive/db/archive.info' or '/db-backups-pgbackrest-2/archive/db/archive.info.copy': [...]`, but maybe it kickstarted something)
			* 1.6.2.5\) In the same pod, run `pgbackrest stop`, followed by `pgbackrest start` a few minutes later. (the `stop` command's effects didn't seem to complete when I tried it, so I ran `start` later to get things up and running again, after trying the other steps)
