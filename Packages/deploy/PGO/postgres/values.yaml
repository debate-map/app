# General #
###########

# name is the name of the cluster. This defaults to the name of the Helm
# release.
name: debate-map

# postgresVersion sets the version to deploy. This version number needs to be
# available as one of the "RELATED_IMAGE_POSTGRES_..." images as part of the PGO
# installation if you want to deploy the image without setting the "postgres"
# image variable. This value is required.
#postgresVersion: 14
#postgresVersion: 13
postgresVersion: 15

# postGISVersion if sets and coupled with a PostGIS enabled container, enables
# PostGIS. This version number needs to be available as one of the
# "RELATED_IMAGE_POSTGRES_..." images as part of the PGO installation if you
# want to deploy the image without setting the "postgres" image variable.
# postGISVersion: 3.1

# NOTE: pgBackRest is enabled by default. It must be set in
# "RELATED_IMAGE_PGBACKREST" on the PGO deployment, otherwise you will need to
# override the "pgBackRest" image.

# pgBouncerReplicas sets the number of pgBouncer instances to deploy. The
# default is 0. You need to set this to at least 1 to deploy pgBouncer or set
# "pgBouncerConfig". Setting "pgBouncerConfig" will override the value of
# pgBouncerReplicas. The "RELATED_IMAGE_PGBOUNCER" in the PGO deployment must be
# set if you want to enable this without explicitly setting "pgBouncer".
# pgBouncerReplicas: 1

# monitoring enables the ability to monitor the Postgres cluster through a
# metrics exporter than can be scraped by Prometheus. This defaults to the value
# below.
# monitoring: false

# Image Overrides #
###################

# imagePostgres can be a Postgres or GIS-enabled Postgres image. This defaults to the
# below value. "postgresVersion" needs to match the version of Postgres that is
# used here. If using the GIS-enabled Postgres image, you need to ensure
# "postGISVersion" matches the version of PostGIS used.
# imagePostgres: registry.developers.crunchydata.com/crunchydata/crunchy-postgres:ubi8-13.8-1

# imagePgBackRest is the pgBackRest backup utility image. This defaults to the
# below value.
# imagePgBackRest: registry.developers.crunchydata.com/crunchydata/crunchy-pgbackrest:ubi8-2.41-2

# imagePgBouncer is the image for the PgBouncer connection pooler. This defaults
# to the below value.
# imagePgBouncer: registry.developers.crunchydata.com/crunchydata/crunchy-pgbouncer:ubi8-1.17-5

# imageExporter is the image name for the exporter used as a part of monitoring.
# This defaults to the value below.
# imageExporter: registry.developers.crunchydata.com/crunchydata/crunchy-postgres-exporter:ubi8-5.3.0-0

# Basic Postgres Settings #
###########################

# instanceName lets you set the name of your instances. This defaults to
# the value below. Setting "instances" overrides this value.
# instanceName: instance1

# instanceSize sets the size of the volume that contains the data. This defaults
# to the value below. Settings "instances" overrides this value.
instanceSize: 10Gi

# V-NOTE on instanceSize above + the 3 related sizes in contents below:
# ==========
# * You might hit a situation where you want to increase the sizes slightly, eg. to fix an urgent out-of-space issue.
# * When I did X.1Gi, that seemed to work in past. (didn't really check logs for errors though)
# * Recently when I tried X.1Gi, I checked logs and noticed an error/warning of "size not being an integer" or something.
# * So then I tried entering an exact bytes value (to avoid fractions theoretically possible from 10% of Gi), that avoided the integer issue, but...
#   ...seemed to result in a persistent-volume of X+1Gi, rather than X.1Gi. (the PVC sizes appeared as expected though) 

# instanceMemory sets the memory limit for the Postgres instances. This defaults
# to no limit being set, but an example value is set below. Settings "instances"
# overrides this value.
# instanceMemory: 2Gi

# instanceCPU sets the CPU limit for the Postgres instances. This defaults to
# no limit being set, but an example value is set below. Setting "instances"
# overrides this value.
# instanceCPU: 1000m

# instanceReplicas lets you set the total number of Postgres replicas. This
# defaults to the value below. More than on replica enables high availability
# (HA). Settings "instances" overrides this value.
# instanceReplicas: 1

##############################
# Advanced Postgres Settings #
##############################

# instances allows you to define one or more Postgres instance sets. By default,
# PGO will only deploy a single instance. Each instance set has similar
# characteristics to the other instances in the set, e.g. storage size, resource
# etc. You can have multiple replicas within an instance set.
#
# This allows you to fully customize the topology of your Postgres instances.
#
# For example, to set up an instance set with HA (due to the default pod
# topology spread constraints)
#
# instances:
#   - name: pgha1
#     replicas: 2
#     dataVolumeClaimSpec:
#       accessModes:
#       - "ReadWriteOnce"
#       resources:
#         requests:
#           storage: 1Gi
# instances: {}

# port sets the port that Postgres listens on. Defaults to 5432.
# port: 5432

# patroni lets you set the Patroni configuration for the Postgres cluster.
# for example, to set up synchronous replication:
# patroni:
#   dynamicConfiguration:
#     synchronous_mode: true
#     postgresql:
#       parameters:
#         synchronous_commit: "on"
patroni:
  dynamicConfiguration:
    postgresql:
      #parameters:
      #  max_parallel_workers: 2
      #  max_worker_processes: 2
      #  shared_buffers: 1GB
      #  work_mem: 2MB

      # values for parameters based on [https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua] and [https://stackoverflow.com/a/32584211]
      # NOTE: To apply these changes:
      # 1) Make sure kubectl/docker-desktop has the right cluster set. (use docker-desktop's tray-icon)
      # 2) Run this in repo root: `kubectl apply -k Packages/deploy/PGO/postgres`
      # 3) This "shouldn't" be necessary, but atm I've found that I need to kill the "debate-map-instance1-XXX" pod for changes to be applied (at least quickly); after doing so, the pod will restart in a half minute or so.
      # 4) Confirm that changes were applied, by using Lens to open terminal in the "debate-map-instance1-XXX" pod, running `psql`, then running: `SHOW max_connections;`

        # for 15gb node
