# The HTTP (ie. non-HTTPS) gateway. It's used for:
# 1) Serving the proxy requests coming from Cloudflare/[debatemap/debates].app. (will probably switch it to use the HTTPS gateway in the future)
# 2) Serving the ECMA tls-certificate provisioning process.
# 3) For various debugging/development purposes.
