Welcome to the Debate Map platform.

The purpose of this site is to "map" debates and discussions into a tree-based format, where it's easier to analyze the logic behind each argument.

One of these maps has been created for an existing conversation, which took place at: [...]

Continue to the next step to begin displaying the comments made by those involved, and examining their logical connections with each other.
==========
The conversation began with the following message:
[comment author="Person1" date="Oct 2, 9:20"]
The earth is spherical!
[/comment]

Let's break down this text to find the main idea, which one side supports and the other opposes. This will be called the "root claim".

[node id="436"/]

The above is a graphical representation of the "root claim", as understood by the map author [(Stephen Wicklund)]. You can hover your mouse over it to see additional details, vote on its probability, etc.

Once ready, press the button below (or go to the next step) to connect this "root claim" onto the debate map's tree-structure.

==========
After the root claim was introduced, various people added comments arguing for or against it. We're now going to go through each of these comments, and break-down/simplify them, to see what exactly they were claiming, and how those claims connect with the ideas already presented.

[comment author="Person1" date="Oct 2, 9:20"]

[/comment]

Let's convert this into a set of premises:

[node id="436"/]

[text textSize="13"](If you consider this conversion innacurate, you can suggest corrections [here](https://debatemap.live/forum/12).)[/text]

Press the button below (or go to the next step) to connect this argument (set of premises) with the rest of the debate map.

If you see potential improvements to the Debate Map website, or this particular map (for example, if the map creator misinterpreted some comments, or failed to include some important points), feel free to get involved and help make improvements. Some ways you can help: (as permitted by the moderators and map author)
* Vote on the strengths/probabilities of the map's arguments and claims.
* Add new arguments and counter-arguments! This is the most substantial way to help, however, it may take some time to learn the contribution workflow. Take it slow, and try to match the contribution format of existing content.
* Ask questions and engage in discussion on existing nodes. (in a node's "Discussion" panel)
* Suggest improvements to the website, or even help develop new features! (the project is [open-source](https://github.com/Venryx/DebateMap))
* Follow the Debate Map community on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/debatemap), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/debatemaps), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateMap), etc. Additional links: [debatemap.live/more](https://debatemap.live/more)
